          para utilizar um pseudo classe e usado a tag mais dois pontos p:,
          acima estilizei o span:hover que e quando eu passar o mouse sobre o

        <p>
          sempre que usar um link na pagina devemos utilizar a estilizacao do

          Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi form symbioses with the roots of
          most plants across nearly every ecosystem on Earth. AM-plant
          interactions usually involve transfer of AM-acquired nutrients from
          the soil, such as phosphate and nitrate, to the plant host in exchange
          for carbohydrates (i.e. sugars) and lipids generated through
          photosynthesis. This intimate association often imparts multiple
          benefits to host plants, such as enriched nutrient status and priming
          of plant defences, both of which can increase growth and disease
          resistance. AM fungi are therefore ecologically important and of great
          interest for potential exploitation in agriculture to help reduce the
          need for application of chemical inputs. Carbon-for-nutrient exchange
          between AM fungi and their hosts is relatively well-studied in single
          AM-plant interactions, however in natural systems plants interact
          concurrently with a myriad of additional organisms that may span the
          entire symbiotic continuum from parasitic to mutualistic interactions.
          Our previous research demonstrated that when AM-colonised potato roots
          are parasitised by plant-parasitic nematodes (economically important
          pathogens of crops), the host plant dramatically reduces the transfer
          of carbon resources to the fungus. However, the mechanisms
          underpinning this dynamic and competitive allocation of host resources
          was unknown.
