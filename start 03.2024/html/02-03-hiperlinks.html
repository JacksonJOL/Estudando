      ABSTRACT Carnivorous plants reverse the order we expect in nature: here,
      animals do not feed on plants, but plants hunt and feed on animal prey,
      primarily insects, thereby enabling these plants to survive in
      nutrient-poor environments. In addition to this strategy, some carnivorous
      plants also form unique symbiotic relationships with animals other than
      insects to access nutrients. Other important interactions of carnivorous
      plants with insects, such as pollinators and herbivores, have received far
      less attention or have been largely neglected. This review describes and
      summarizes various ecologically relevant biotic interactions between
      carnivorous plants and other organisms reported in recent studies. In
      particular, our understanding on how carnivorous plants, for example,
      handle the pollinator–prey-conflict or interact with and respond to
      herbivores is still incomplete. Strategies and mechanisms on how
      carnivorous plants address these challenges are presented. Finally, future
      directions in carnivorous plant research are proposed. KEYWORDS: Plant

      Previous article View issue table of contents Next article 1. Introduction
      Plants have adapted to utilize all available habitats, from tropical to
      arctic climates, arid to semi-arid zones, damp to waterlogged areas, and
      maximum sunshine to full shade. Therefore, as an adaptation to
      nutrient-poor environments, insectivory – or in a broader sense carnivory
      – may have evolved in some plants to compensate for shortages in soil
      composition (Juniper et al. Citation1989; Ellison and Adamec
      Citation2018a). Catching and digesting prey, mainly insects, by using
      specialized traps (Figure 1) is considered as an alternate mechanism for
      acquiring supplemental nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and
      potassium (Ellison Citation2006; Mithöfer Citation2011). Since all
      carnivorous plants can still fix carbon dioxide and absorb inorganic and
      organic nutrients from captured prey, they are mixotrophic. The
      ‘carnivorous syndrome’ refers to development by changes in anatomical
      structure, glandular structure, gene expression, and evolutionary
      characteristics (Pavlovič et al. Citation2007). About 810 of the 250,000
      flowering plants species are carnivorous, mostly belonging to Nepenthales
      and Lamiales (Adamec et al. Citation2021). The carnivorous syndrome in
      plants has developed independently in the plant kingdom at least 11 times
      and can be found in 13 different plant families including a recently
      described new species (Triantha occidentalis; Tofieldiaceae) (Fleischmann
      et al. Citation2018; Lin et al. Citation2021). Therefore, carnivorous
      plants are a polyphyletic group with distinct features and prey-capturing
      abilities. Figure 1. Carnivorous plant species with typical traps. (A)

      experimentally proved the fact of plant carnivory and laid the foundation
      for all subsequent research related to this topic in his book
      ‘Insectivorous Plants’ (Darwin Citation1875). Darwin described the traps
      structures in eight different plant genera (Drosophyllum, Drosera,
      Dionaea, Aldrovanda, Roridula, Pinguicula, Utricularia, and Byblis), all
      being able to catch insects or other prey. He further described the
      structure of sticky, hinged, and suction traps in detail, but also
      mentioned gliding traps. Darwin noted that pepsin-like enzymes directly
      digest the animal proteins (Darwin Citation1875; also in Hepburn
      Citation1922; Hepburn et al. Citation1927). Francis Darwin (Citation1878)
      further concluded that the plant absorbs these nutrients, which contribute
      to the plant growth and development. In the last 25 years, molecular and
      all ‘–omics’ approaches provided deep insight into the biology,
      physiology, and evolution of carnivorous plants. In particular, intensive
      work on Darwin’s ‘most wonderful plant of the world,’ the Venus flytrap
      (Dionaea muscipula), gained fascinating insights into the molecular
      physiology and origin of plant carnivory and contributed significantly to
      our understanding of carnivorous syndrome in this particular plant and
      also in general (for review, see Hedrich and Fukushima Citation2021). In
      addition, comprehensive publications recently covered the systematics,
      evolution, and (eco)physiology of carnivorous plants (Ellison and Adamec
      Citation2018a; Adamec et al. Citation2021). In this article, I provide an
      overview on the various biotic interactions of carnivorous plants (Figure
      2). Besides summarizing their interactions with prey and addressing the
      related question whether carnivorous plants are predators, I focus, in
      particular, on the often neglected interactions with pollinators and
      herbivores, emphasizing the signals involved in attraction and defense
      responses. Figure 2. Scheme of carnivorous plant (sundew, flypaper-trap)

      There are several definitions for the term ‘carnivory’ in the plant
      kingdom. The basic definition implies that a carnivorous plant has the
      ability to absorb products of prey decomposition. This is done either
      directly through the leaves or through the roots, and increases fitness
      and seed production at the same time (Chase et al. Citation2009).
      Accordingly, all plants can be carnivorous to some degree, but only those
      that can be referred to as ‘true’ carnivores (or holocarnivores) should
      have the ability to (1) specifically attract, (2) capture, and (3) digest
      prey and utilize the metabolic products for their own growth (Lloyd
      Citation1942; Chase et al. Citation2009). Recently, Ellison and Adamec
      (Citation2018b) have rephrased the definition for holocarnivory. They
      postulated five essential characteristics for the carnivorous syndrome:
      (1) capture of prey in specialized (and attractive) traps, (2) killing,
      (3) digesting, (4) absorption of nutrients from the digested prey, and (5)
      utilizing nutrients for plant growth and development. In holocarnivorous
      plants such as Nepenthes and Drosera, endogenous, specific hydrolytic
      enzymes can facilitate digestion. Plants that do not meet all the
      requirements are to be recognized as holocarnivorous, or those that cannot
      supply the enzymes needed for digestion are called hemicarnivorous
      (Ellison and Adamec Citation2018b; Adamec et al. Citation2021). Most
      Heliamphora species are an example of this, which require the assistance
      of microbes living in passive traps, but can absorb the resulting
      nutrients itself (Chase et al. Citation2009). However, these
      classifications are not fixed but are very dynamic and depend on new
      findings. Traps and trapping strategies can be divided into active and
      passive traps according to their potential of mobility of the evolved
      trapping mechanisms (Król et al. Citation2012). Morphological changes or
      metamorphoses of leaf structures have produced the different trap types
      involved in prey capture (Figure 3) (Fukushima et al. Citation2015; Dkhar
      and Pareek Citation2019; Dávila-Lara et al. Citation2020; Whitewoods et
      al. Citation2020). Interestingly, certain traps are often the result of
      convergent evolution, for example, pitcher traps in the families
      Nepenthaceae, Cephalotaceae, and Sarraceniaceae (Thorogood et al.
      Citation2017). Altogether, there are five different trapping mechanisms,
      three of which are active, two are passive traps (Figure 1). An active
      trap is the one in which accelerated trapping motion is an integral
      feature of the trapping process; for example, the snap-trap of Dionaea
      muscipula (Venus flytrap), the flypaper-traps of Drosera (sundew) and
      Pinguicula (butterwort), or the sucking bladder-traps of Utricularia
      (bladderwort). In passive traps, accelerated movement is absent in the
      trapping mechanism surface (Pietropaolo and Pietropaolo Citation2001). The
      eel-trap of Genlisea (corkscrew plant) is one example; others are pitfall
      (pitcher) traps of Cephalotus follicularis (Albany pitcher plant),
      Darlingtonia californica (cobra lily), and species of the genera
      Sarracenia (trumpet pitchers), Heliamphora (sun pitchers), and Nepenthes
      (tropical pitcher plants or monkey cups). Strikingly, many of the genes
      triggered in traps after prey capture and involved in carnivore processes
      appear to have evolved or been reassigned from herbivore defense
      mechanisms. Among those are genes encoding various hydrolytic enzymes
      involved in prey digestion (for a detailed overview, Ravee et al.
      Citation2018), ion channels, and transporters, as well as defense-related
      proteins and biosynthetic enzymes for signaling and defensive compounds.
      It is now generally accepted that the plant carnivore syndrome evolved
      from plant defense mechanisms, and the tools available to combat attackers
      were now used to capture, digest, and exploit prey (Mithöfer Citation2011;
      Pavlovič and Saganová Citation2015; Bemm et al. Citation2016; Fleischmann
      et al. Citation2018; Hedrich and Fukushima Citation2021). Figure 3.

      S. Zunk). Display full size It is worth to mention that attributes that
      differentiate carnivorous plants are also present in plants not considered
      to be carnivorous (Porembski and Barthlott Citation2006), such as visual
      and odiferous lures, directional guides, secreting glands, trapping,
      absorbing glands, and rapid movement. For example, some non-carnivorous
      plants like Arum species arrest visiting flies within the inflorescence
      during the male phase of anthesis, in order to secure pollen export
      (Bröderbauer et al. Citation2013). Some leaves display fast motion in
      plants like Mimosa pudica and Desmodium spp (Paudel and Shrestha
      Citation2018). Secreted sticky material (mucilage) can provide various
      functions such as modifying soil structures, attracting microbes, or
      helping climbing (Galloway et al. Citation2020). While all the individual
      characteristics of carnivorous plants can also be found in other plants,
      only the organism that has integrated all these characteristics into one
      plant is special: a carnivorous plant whose adapted leaves can attract,
      capture, and digest prey as an additional nutrient source to eventually
      derive benefit resulting in growth, survival, or reproduction (Brownlee
      Citation2013). 3. Carnivorous plants – prey interaction A comprehensive
      analysis by Ellison and Gotelli (Citation2009), covering 30 studies on 8
      carnivorous genera (46 species) between 1923 and 2007, suggested that
      carnivorous plants are not selective predators concerning prey
      composition. The main prey of carnivorous plants are invertebrates, i.e.
      arthropods, mainly insects. This holds true, in particular, for
      terrestrial carnivorous plants. Due to their aquatic (Utricularia spp) and
      wet-terrestrial (Utricularia and Genlisea spp) lifestyle, these plants
      also catch, for example, nematodes and protozoa. Submerge living
      Utricularia catch all kind of aquatic invertebrates, mainly copepods and
      water fleas (Cladocera) (Ellison and Gotelli Citation2009; Horstmann et
      al. Citation2019), but anecdotally also small young fish and even tadpoles
      (Lloyd Citation1942) (given that the trap is big enough). A zooplankton
      prey spectrum can be found for the aquatic Aldrovanda vesiculosa
      (Horstmann et al. Citation2019; Poppinga et al. Citation2019). Among
      terrestrial carnivorous plants, ants and flies dominate captured prey
      (Figure 4). Pitcher plants (Nepenthes and Sarracenia) showed the highest
      proportions of ants in their diets, while flies (Diptera) dominated in
      plants with flypaper traps (Drosera, Pinguicula) (Ellison and Gotelli
      Citation2009). These findings reflect that besides the trap size, the
      different morphological trap specializations in these genera are also prey
      selection criteria (Darnowski et al. Citation2018). Figure 4. Prey
      distribution in selected terrestrial carnivorous plant genera. Slices of
      each ‘star’ plot are scaled to the average proportion of each prey taxon
      (order except for ants – family Formicidae). Only the 12 most common prey
      orders are shown. Color key is given in the lower right. Figure was

      with permission of the authors. Display full size Some pitchers of
      Nepenthes and Sarracenia are so big that larger prey, such as frogs, rats,
      or lizards are found to be partially digested inside the pitcher
      (Adlassnig et al. Citation2011; Wells et al. Citation2011). This
      phenomenon shows that prey of carnivorous plants is not restricted to
      invertebrates only. Whether these catches really contribute regularly to
      the life style of carnivorous plants or represent accidents remains to be
      solved. It is also worth mentioning that few carnivorous plants can be
      seen as herbivores or omnivores. In particular, N. ampullaria plants
      possess large pitchers sitting on the ground with wide openings waiting
      for leaves and other organic material falling down, which can be digested
      (Moran et al. Citation2003; Pavlovič et al. Citation2011). In addition,
      adhesive traps, e.g. from Pinguicula and Drosera, in general, are suitable
      not only to capture small animals but also for the collection of
      plant-derived organic particles like pollen grains (Juniper et al.
      Citation1989; Adlassnig et al. Citation2010). However, most carnivorous
      plants consume a wide range of prey. Generally, in order to capture and
      digest prey, the plants face the challenge to attract prey. For aquatic
      carnivorous plants, the mode of attraction is unknown. However, for
      Genlisea, results of behavioral experiments showed that prey move to the
      traps by accident. The plant does not need special mediators for its
      attraction (Płachno et al. Citation2008). Very likely, the same counts for
      the free-floating Utricularia species, although chemical attractants are
      discussed as well (Albert et al. Citation2010). For carnivorous
      terrestrial plants, three main strategies for attracting prey are most
      likely important: (i) visual stimuli, (ii) olfactory stimuli, and (iii)
      extrafloral nectar (EFN) as a reward. Combinations of these strategies are
      also conceivable. 3.1. Visual cues – colors Visual signals seem to be
      important in the attraction of diurnal prey. It is obvious that the traps
      of many carnivorous plants (Droseraceae, Nepenthaceae, and Sarraceniaceae)
      have an intensive red color, due to the presence of anthocyanins
      (Dávila-Lara et al. Citation2021b). Red coloration increases capture
      efﬁciency of Nepenthes traps by providing attractive visual signals, i.e.
      the rates of caught insects positively correlate with levels of red
      pigmentation (Schaefer and Ruxton Citation2008). Thus, red color may
      directly enhance the trap efﬁciency or indirectly provide a useful
      background for better recognition. However, the relative importance of
      visual cues has been a pivotal point of debate. While Schaefer and Ruxton
      (Citation2008) considered red coloration of pitcher plant traps serving as
      an attractant, Bennett and Ellison (Citation2009) questioned the
      conclusion. Instead, they suggested that the pitcher color patterns do not
      provide important signals for prey attraction but EFN. In addition, for
      Drosera rotundifolia, it was demonstrated that the red trap color was not
      involved in prey attraction (Foot et al. Citation2014). It should be
      mentioned here that most insect taxa found as prey are red-blind or at
      least cannot perceive all wavelengths that constitute the color ‘red’ to
      our human perception (Briscoe and Chittka Citation2001). Even if red traps
      reﬂect wavelengths in blue or green-yellow wavelengths (Moran et al.
      Citation1999), their visibility to a red-blind insect would depend on the
      contrast against the background of the surrounding green vegetation
      (Jürgens et al. Citation2009). Other studies suggested an impact of visual
      cues within the UV light range, which is visible for insects, rather than
      within the longer wavelength range (Joel et al. Citation1985; Kurup et al.
      Citation2013). Thus, to what extent any trap coloration is involved in
      prey attraction remains an open question. Another possible strategy to
      attract and guide prey into a trap is realized by the presence of
      (semi)-translucent areas in pitcher plants with hooded traps. Nepenthes
      aristolochoides has a translucent dome at the rear of the pitcher (Moran
      et al. Citation2012). Other pitcher plants have spots in the back of the
      hood tissues, so-called fenestrations, or areoles in case these
      fenestrations contain a white pigment (Darlingtonia californica and
      Sarracenia species) (Schaefer and Ruxton Citation2014; McGregor et al.
      Citation2016). For insects, these transparent windows mimic exits of the
      pitchers; however, they ultimately guide the prey deeper into the trap.
      3.2. Olfactory cues – scent Many carnivorous plants from various taxa are
      capable of releasing volatile compounds from trapping leaves. For example,
      various Sarracenia species, N. rafflesiana (here the pitchers from the
      upper, climbing part), and D. muscipula emit volatiles mimicking ﬂower or
      fruit scents (Di Giusto et al. Citation2008; Jürgens et al. Citation2009;
      Kreuzwieser et al. Citation2014). Much lower scent and less compounds are
      released from Drosera binata and S. purpurea; here, the emitted compounds
      are more comparable with typical leaf volatiles (Jürgens et al.
      Citation2009). By using choice assays in the absence of any visual cue, in
      N. rafflesiana, the scents of the nectariferous peristome were
      particularly attractive to ants and ﬂies, and those of upper pitchers were
      more attractive to ﬂies than those of lower pitchers (Di Giusto et al.
      Citation2010). This study supported the finding of Moran (Citation1996)
      who found more flying prey in the upper pitchers than in the lower ones.
      Unique in the carnivorous plant kingdom is the specialization of N.
      albomarginata, whose food source is restricted to only one prey taxon.
      With a wreath of white feeding hairs (trichomes) directly under the
      peristome, it attracts exclusively termites of the subfamily
      Nasutitermitinae (predominantly Hospitalitermes spp.), which are virtually
      blind. The termites congregate there in massive quantities, consequently
      fall into the pitcher and are digested (Merbach et al. Citation2002). Some
      species of carnivorous plants emit a different blend of volatiles from
      their flowers and traps to attract, on the one hand, the prey insect
      species and, on the other hand, repel pollinators from the traps (El-Sayed
      et al. Citation2016). All these studies support the role of olfactory cues
      in the attraction process. 3.3. Extrafloral nectar – a reward Many insects
      are attracted by sweet extrafloral nectar, in particular ants. The
      presence of nectaries and the production of EFN has been shown for almost
      all carnivorous plant taxa but the focus of studies was on pitcher plants
      (Płachno Citation2007). In N. bicalcarata, EFN is involved in a very
      special myrmecophilic interaction (see subsequently). In S. purpurea,
      Bennett and Ellison (Citation2009) demonstrated the attractiveness of EFN
      for insects, mainly ants. For some Nepenthes species, it has been shown
      that the EFN on the peristome is part of the trapping mechanism because
      water droplets spread rapidly and form homogeneous thin films, which make
      the peristome extremely slippery for insects that finally fall into the
      trap (Bohn and Federle Citation2004). The EFN production in carnivorous
      plants occurs close to or within the trapping zones; thus, the insects
      reaching for the nectar need to enter and remain in a highly dangerous
      area. This will definitely increase the probability of being captured –
      but not for sure. Therefore, escaped, but EFN-rewarded, social insects
      such as ants will tell others in their colony and many more will return
      (Bauer et al. Citation2015). However, it is unknown how prey finds the
      EFN, whether just accidently when passing by or if there is something
      attractive. Altogether, with few exceptions, under natural conditions,
      there is usually a high variability of prey composition making conclusions
      on its speciﬁcity for most carnivorous plants difﬁcult. 4. Are carnivorous
      plants predators? When talking about carnivory in plants, it is necessary
      to take the next step and ask: Are these plants hunting and are they
      predators? Ellison (Citation2020) has recently discussed this deeply.
      Including different theories and foraging strategies, he concluded that
      carnivorous plants are predators that do hunt following the sit-and-wait
      strategy. While active foraging involves active searching for suitable
      patches and for prey, carnivorous plants remain rooted to a single
      location and depend on the abundance and movement of their prey. Since
      carnivorous plants use traps for capturing prey, probably the sit-and-wait
      strategy of spiders hunting with spiderwebs is a comparable strategy.
      However, because carnivorous plants sit and never move, they can be
      considered as the purest form of sit-and-wait predators. Thus, they might
      be comparable to sessile filter feeders (e.g. barnacles and mussels).
      Interestingly, it was suggested that carnivorous plants may benefit from
      group foraging, like a wolf pack (Savage and Miller Citation2018). Based
      on a field experiment, the authors found that larger groups of S. flava
      caught a greater mass of prey. However, the rate of all prey per leaf and
      the number of individuals from different insect orders were statistically
      indistinguishable between groups of different sizes (Savage and Miller
      Citation2018). In contrast, another field observation suggested that high
      neighborhood density in Drosera makinoi increased both the number of
      larger prey (≥ 3 mm) and the captured prey biomass per plant (Tagawa and
      Watanabe Citation2021). Here, however, the explanation might be that more
      sticky tentacles from different plants are able to catch and hold stronger
      and larger insects, preventing prey from escaping, than a single plant
      ever could. Thus, the trapping mode may contribute to the success of group
      foraging. Nevertheless, up to now, there is no clear scientific evidence
      that carnivorous plants benefit from group foraging. 5. Carnivorous plants
      and symbiotic interactions Knowledge of the mechanisms underlying
      interactions between carnivorous plants and arthropod prey contributed to
      the notion of evolutionary associations that reveal new symbiotic
      relationships. Some carnivorous plants have unique mutualistic
      relationships with other organisms that contribute to or replace prey
      capture and digestion, such as (i) digestive mutualism, (ii) coprophagy,
      and (iii) myrmecophily. In these cases, carnivorous plants show general
      concepts of coevolution. More examples of other, non-mutualistic
      relationships will be presented as follows as well. 5.1. Digestive
      mutualism Digestive mutualism represents an alternative strategy of prey
      digestion. Here, the help of other organisms is necessary and involved to
      digest captured prey. Actually, with respect to the definition mentioned
      previously, these plants are hemicarnivorous. This phenotype can be often
      found in new-world pitcher plants of the genus Heliamphora and few
      Sarracenia species (S. rosea and S. flava) (Jaffe et al. Citation1992;
      Koller-Peroutka et al. Citation2019). In these cases, the plants provide a
      micro-environment in their pitchers which is colonized by micro-organisms
      such as protozoa, fungi, and micro-algae, rotifers, and various taxa of
      arthropods (Adlassnig et al. Citation2011). This is possible because the
      fluid in these pitchers is highly diluted and similar to water, in
      contrast to the old-world pitcher plants (Nepenthes), where the fluid is
      acidic and contains antimicrobial compounds and digestive enzymes (Buch et
      al. Citation2013). The inquilines contribute to the digestion with enzyme
      secretion, release of nutrients, mechanical break-up and remove of
      excessive prey, and even assimilation of nitrogen (Adlassnig et al.
      Citation2011). However, it is difficult to imagine that within the same
      genus, some species can secrete digestive enzymes into the pitcher fluid
      and others cannot. Maybe, this trait got lost during evolution.
      Strikingly, the presence of inquilines is not fully restricted to the
      new-world pitcher plants. Also for Nepenthes, there are examples where
      crab-spiders (Thomisidae) or dipteran larvae (Culicidae and Phoridae)
      somehow can inhabit pitchers (Lam et al. Citation2017; Lim et al.
      Citation2018). The dipteran larvae contribute to prey digestion, and the
      crab-spiders catch flies and defecate into the pitcher, thereby providing
      nutrients for the plant. Another example of a mutualistic digestive
      mechanism is the interaction between Roridula gorgonias, an endemic
      species in South Africa, and the hemipteran bug Pameridea roridulae (Ellis
      and Midgley Citation1996; Anderson and Midgley Citation2003). These plants
      catch insects with their sticky tentacles (flypaper trap) but cannot
      digest the trapped insects. Instead, the bug Pameridea roridulae that
      lives on the plant sucks out insect juices and later the plant absorbs
      nutrients from the bug's droppings. Strikingly, Pamerida can only live on
      Roridula species. Due to their special hairy feet, they are able to walk
      on the leaves’ surface without being caught. Although nutrient absorption
      in Roridula is an indirect process, it is extremely effective. Digestive
      mutualism may be considered as a specialized adaptation to the carnivorous
      syndrome because they reduce the costs of produce digestive enzyme
      production. However, this applies more to Roridula than to the new-world
      pitcher plants, since in the latter, sometimes large number of inquilines
      also absorb the released nutrients. 5.2. Coprophagy The former interaction
      between Roridula–Pamerida is an example where the plant gets nutrients
      from feces. This situation is also realized in three Nepenthes species, N.
      lowii, N. rajah, and N. macrophylla; but here the plants interact with
      vertebrates (Clarke et al. Citation2009; Chin et al. Citation2010;
      Greenwood et al. Citation2011). Actually, the plants benefit from the
      nitrogen in the feces of small mammals that defecate into the pitchers.
      Such an animal is the mountain shrew, Tupaia montana. The shrews are
      rewarded with nectar from the lid of the pitcher. To get there, they sit
      on the pitcher’s opening and relax while feeding (Clarke et al.
      Citation2009). In addition, rats (Rattus baluensis) have been observed to
      visit N. rajah and behave similar (Greenwood et al. Citation2011).
      Similarly, while roosting inside, individuals of the bat species Kerivoula
      hardwickii defecate into pitchers of N. hemsleyana (Grafe et al.
      Citation2011; Schöner et al. Citation2017). In this case, the presence and
      employment of a tissue-localized urease enables the plant to efficiently
      metabolize the bat-derived nitrogen because it is mainly provided as urea
      (Yilamujiang et al. Citation2017). Hence, the visiting activity of
      mutualistic mammalians can significantly increase nitrogen content in the
      carnivorous host plants. However, these Nepenthes species retained the
      ability to catch and utilize prey. 5.3. Myrmecophily The only known
      carnivorous plant that lives in a mutualistic interaction with an ant
      species is N. bicalcarata (Clarke and Kitching Citation1995). The ant
      species, Camponotus schmitzi, provides protection against an herbivorous
      weevil that feeds on pitcher buds and gets housing in hollow tendrils
      called domatia (Merbach et al. Citation2007). Ant colonies are small,
      comprising only about 30 individuals. C. schmitzi feed on the nectar
      excretions from the pitcher but in addition on carcasses of N. bicalcarata
      prey, which they remove from the fluid in the pitcher. Strikingly, these
      ants can dive and swim in the pitcher fluid and, furthermore, they can
      walk on the slippery wet peristome surface due to their specialized arolia
      (adhesive lobes) on their feet (Bohn Citation2007). This is almost
      impossible for all other known insects that encounter Nepenthes species.
      However, if some individuals try to escape, they are attacked by the C.
      schmitzi ants and forced back into the pitcher. This is further
      facilitated by a cleaning behavior of the ants. In this process, they
      remove everything such as particles and hyphae from the peristome to keep
      it as slippery as possible (Thornham et al. Citation2012). Finally, the
      ants remove the caught insects and feed on them before they dropped the
      remaining uneaten pieces back into the pitcher (Bonhomme et al.
      Citation2011). In addition, they feed the plant with feces and their dead
      bodies (Bazile et al. Citation2012). In this particular case, the
      ant–plant interaction could be a nutritional mutualism consisting of
      carnivory and myrmecotrophy. 5.4. Non-mutualistic interactions Other
      striking interactions are known as kleptoparasitism. Larvae of the
      predatory dipteran hoverfly Toxomerus basalis (Syrphidae) have been found
      crawling and living the complete larval stage on the sticky leaves of
      various Drosera species in Southeast Brazil. This syrphid obviously feeds
      on carcasses trapped by Drosera leaves, showing also a kleptoparasitic
      behavior (Fleischmann et al. Citation2016). In contrast to the situation
      in Roridula–Pamerida relationship, here the syrphine larvae do not
      defecate during their feeding period until they pupate. Thus, no nutrient
      return to the plant from larval excretions occurs (Fleischmann et al.
      Citation2016). Similarly, the relationship between Pinguicula
      vallisneriifolia and the slug Deroceras hilbrandi also shows
      kleptoparasitic characteristics (Zamora and Gómez Citation1996). The slug
      feeds on old, dry, and fresh carcasses that were captured by the plant; in
      the latter case, the plant is derived of nutrients. This behavior is
      possible because the slugs are able to crawl on the leaves without being
      trapped. In particular during summer, the slug spends long time periods on
      the plant. Recently, a putative commensalistic interaction between
      Nepenthes and birds was described. Bauer et al. (Citation2016) observed a
      diverse guild of vertebrates consisting of four sunbird species and a tree
      shrew species visiting pitchers of Nepenthes for nectar robbing. The
      vertebrates harvested nectar from the peristome of N. rafflesiana and from
      the lid of N. gracilis. Being too big to serve as a prey, these visits
      were without any obvious beneﬁt for the plants. This interaction is more
      likely to be considered as a form of commensalism, because the loss of
      nectar from occasional visits does not seem to affect the plant. However,
      more research is necessary in order to get deeper insights into this
      interaction. 6. Carnivorous plants and pollination Insects pollinate most
      carnivorous plant species. That generates a dilemma between pollination on
      the one side and prey capture on the other side, the so-called
      pollinator–prey-conflict (PPC) (Zamora Citation1999; Jürgens et al.
      Citation2012). Interestingly, this obvious conflict is not as relevant as
      expected. The reasons are as follows. Actually, the PPC can only become a
      dangerous situation for the pollinator insects in carnivorous taxa with
      sticky flypaper traps (Drosera, Pinguicula and Drosophyllum), pitfall
      traps (Nepenthes, Heliamphora, Sarracenia, Cephalotus, and Darlingtonia)
      and snap-traps (Dionaea). The eel traps of Genlisea and the suction traps
      of Utricularia are subterranean or submerged, which avoids the PPC.
      Aldovandra vesiculosa is obligate autogamous (Cross et al. Citation2018).
      For Dionaea muscipula, Youngsteadt et al. (Citation2018) recently showed
      that the spatial separation of flowers and traps, probably by the long
      flower stalk, can help separate pollinators from prey. This principle of
      spatial separation can also be found e.g. in Drosera, Pinguicula, or
      Sarracenia (Figure 5). In addition, temporal separation might be another
      way to reduce PPC. This can be realized by different seasonal periods for
      flowering and trap activities, which occurs for example in some Sarracenia
      and Pinguicula species (Cross et al. Citation2018). In Nepenthes and
      Heliamphora species, trap activity correlates with periods of high
      humidity, which makes the peristome slippery (Bohn and Federle
      Citation2004). This in turn is a time without many flying insects involved
      in pollination. In addition, in particular, Nepenthes captures mainly ants
      as prey while winged insects act as pollinators (Cross et al.
      Citation2018). These aforementioned examples explain the observation that
      in pitfall traps no obvious pollinator–prey species overlap could be
      found, neither in Nepenthes nor in Sarracenia or Heliamphora. In addition
      to the flight ability, the size of the pollinating insects may often be
      important. Bees, humblebees, and moths are involved in pollination, while
      flies and ants serve as prey. Of course, bee capture has also been
      described for the invasive Africanized honeybees (killer bees) in pitchers
      of some Heliamphora species in Venezuela, but it remains the exception.
      (Fleischmann and McPherson Citation2010). In carnivorous plants with
      flypaper traps, small dipterans are the main prey. As reported for
      Drosophyllum lusitanicum (Bertol et al. Citation2015) and various Drosera
      species, again an overlap of pollinator and prey taxa is small or even
      absent (Murza et al. Citation2006; Anderson Citation2010; El-Sayed et al.
      Citation2016). At least for Pinguicula, size matters. The leaves could
      capture small pollinators, e.g. thrips, but not humblebees. The risk
      depends on the size of the pollinators (Zamora Citation1999). Beyond these
      findings, very likely there are additional players involved in pollinator
      and prey attraction. Chemical cues such as volatiles (scent) or floral
      nectar, as well as visible cues (color), can contribute and increase the
      attractiveness of the flower to pollinating insects and to traps for
      insect prey (Jürgens et al. Citation2012). However, such cues and their
      specific role still wait for their identification. As inferred from the
      low similarity between insect pollinators and prey in the different taxa
      of carnivorous plants, the attraction of prey does not seem to be related
      to the attraction of pollinators (Jürgens et al. Citation2012). Figure 5.

      full size 7. Carnivorous plants under insect herbivore attack Almost all
      studies on carnivorous plants focus on the carnivorous syndrome. However,
      plants also face the interaction with herbivorous insects but herbivory on
      carnivorous plants seems rare. In Pinguicula moranensis, more herbivory
      was detected in sunny- than in shade-field sites (Suarez-Piña et al.
      Citation2016). Surprisingly, with respect to the overall performance,
      simulated herbivory unraveled a high tolerance to tissue damage in P.
      moranensis (Ortuño-Mendieta et al. Citation2021). For the same species,
      both field and lab experiments showed that the presence of sticky
      glandular trichomes, which are involved in prey capture, also efficiently
      protect the plant from herbivory (Alcalá et al. Citation2010). Thus, here
      the trichomes have a dual role for the plant and it seems obvious that an
      originally defense-related feature was co-opted during evolution for
      carnivory. However, it is unlikely that all putative herbivores are
      captured and digested. The genus Pinguicula could be an exception due to
      its rosette-like growth habit and the general presence of sticky
      trichomes. In different Drosera species, sundew plume moth larvae
      (Buckleria paludum) were described to live and develop on the carnivorous
      plants, feeding on the sticky tentacles, leaf blade, flowers, and fruits
      or only licking the secreted mucilage (Eisner and Shepherd Citation1965;
      Osaki and Tagawa Citation2020). In particular, last instar larvae showed
      the licking behavior, very likely to remove sticky mucilage in order to
      escape the possibility of being captured (Osaki and Tagawa Citation2020).
      No defensive plant reaction in any of these interactions have been
      described so far. Few studies that investigated the attack of insects on
      carnivorous pitcher plants where lepidopteran herbivory was described for
      Sarracenia species are published (Carmickle and Horner Citation2019; Lamb
      and Kalies Citation2020). One study showed infestation of N. bicalcarata
      by a weevil (Alcidodes spec.) but also protection by Camponotus schmitzi
      ants that attack this herbivore (Merbach et al. Citation2007); in N.
      gracilis, a higher herbivory level for green than for red,
      anthocyanin-containing pitchers, was detected (Gilbert et al.
      Citation2018). In contrast, for P. moranensis, such a correlation was not
      found (Ayestarán and Alcalá Citation2016). Recently, herbivore treatment
      with the generalist lepidopteran moth, Spodoptera littoralis, was
      investigated in N. x ventrata and the defense responses were analyzed
      (Dávila-Lara et al. Citation2021a). In that study, at least for N. x
      ventrata leaves, efficient chemical defenses against herbivores were
      identified – on the one hand, the induced trypsin protease inhibitor
      activities, which are well known in plant defense (Mithöfer and Boland
      Citation2012) and, on the other hand, the constitutive presence of
      naphthoquinones such as plumbagin (Figure 6), acting as a phytoanticipin.
      For plumbagin, its anti-feeding and growth-inhibiting activities were
      demonstrated (Rahman-Soad et al. Citation2021; Dávila-Lara et al.
      Citation2021a); moreover, naphthoquinones seem to be widespread among the
      taxa of carnivorous plants belonging to the Caryophyllales (Droseraceae,
      Nepenthaceae, and Drosophyllum) (Schlauer et al. Citation2005; Devi et al.
      Citation2016). Strikingly, in N. x ventrata, only the induction of the
      trypsin inhibitor activity was jasmonate-mediated. In general, these
      phytohormones are well-known key-players in the defense regulation against
      herbivores in plants (Mithöfer and Boland Citation2012; Pavlovič and
      Mithöfer Citation2019). Both inducibility of jasmonates and their
      downstream signaling pathways in various carnivorous plants, e.g. Drosera
      capensis (Nakamura et al. Citation2013; Mithöfer et al. Citation2014), D.
      muscipula (Libiaková et al. Citation2014; Bemm et al. Citation2016), and
      Nepenthes spp. (Yilamujiang et al. Citation2016; Dávila-Lara et al.
      Citation2021a), indicate the presence and a function of typical defense
      responses in carnivorous plants. This has been reviewed recently in depth
      (Pavlovič and Mithöfer Citation2019). Figure 6. Structure of the
      naphthoquinone plumbagin, acting as phytoanticipin in many carnivorous
      plants of the order Caryophyllales, and related derivatives. Figure 6.

      years of research on carnivorous plants, they have not lost their
      fascination, and ongoing research on carnivorous plants is yielding many
      fascinating results. In addition to the new species discovered each year,
      novel interactions with other organisms, including vertebrates, are often
      examples of unexpected and exciting symbiotic relationships. For instance,
      based on similar traits, the genus Nepenthes exhibits many intriguing
      ecological specializations related to nutrient acquisition and seems to be
      a playground for coevolution – but why Nepenthes in particular? What makes
      this genus so special and adaptable to new symbiotic interactions? Studies
      of the genetic and physiological factors that determine the carnivorous
      syndrome will provide deeper insights into its ecology and evolution, and
      to address the question of how did plant carnivory evolve several times
      convergently in the plant kingdom, thereby independently evolving very
      similar traits. However, as shown in this review, these plants should not
      be reduced to their carnivorous syndrome. Studies of their pollination
      have revealed interesting aspects of the pollinator–prey conflict that is
      not yet fully understood. Recently, carnivorous plants and their abilities
      to defend and repel insect herbivores, a long-ignored interaction, have
      been studied. It is tempting to speculate that many secondary metabolites
      involved in plant defense await identification; not least, because
      tropical carnivorous plants in particular are commonly used in traditional
      medicine. Interactions with pathogens are also still waiting to be
      discovered and studied. Why are only so few known? How could these plants
      co-opt molecular tools for defense against pathogens and herbivores for
      carnivory? Are carnivorous plants per se better protected against biotic
      attackers? All of these interactions are in a different ecological
      context, but they interact and influence each other in a common network
      that is far from known. Therefore, these plants and their biotic partners
      represent very special organisms that are of particular interest to the
      entire field of plant biology and ecology. In the future,
      interdisciplinary and ‘-omics’ approaches will be able to address such
      questions and understand all the features of plant carnivory.
